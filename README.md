_The docs of this project are still very incomplete, simply because it's more fun to code than to write a guide. Below is an incomplete main README, which also misses probably all the information you are looking for._

#Nerds
Nerds is a__n__ engin__e__ fo__r__ tile-base__d__ game__s__. It is intended to be easy in use, allowing all major configuration of your project to be done by simply editing text files. This process is easily accessible but is known to be extremely boring, so beware!

##Features
These few features are currently implemented:

* Map renderer based on text files with very easy syntax.
* Character renderer based on slightly harder syntax.
* Character movement and hittest.
* Easy path creation for basic npc movement.
* Dialogue between hero and npc's with easy syntax and option-choosing by the hero.

More will follow.

##How to "Play"

###GNU/Linux:

* Open the terminal.

* Move to this folder.

* Execute `python engine/main.py`

* Enjoy!

##Known issues
_None known._

##Configuration
Most configuration for now is done by editing various text files located in the `data` folder and its subfolders.

##License
Don't know yet. Probably something like MIT or BSD or something like that. Feel free to use it, fork it, adjust it, commit it, send pull requests or send feedback.
