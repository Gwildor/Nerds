Here be all yerr map files.

=== Instructions on map files ===

	* All files should have .map as extension.
	
	* The default map, which gets loaded instead when a map file which the engine attempts to load is not found,
		should be named "main.map". This map also gets loaded if no "new game start map" is specified in the general
		config of your game. When you are making a game with one large (semi-)open world which connets to other maps
		such as buildings etc., then this world map should be the one which is named main.map (although this is not
		mandatory, just a general guideline for clearness).
		
=== Map files syntax ===

{ # general map info, as of this moment this is not used yet by the engine, but it might get later
pref_name: value
pref_name_2: value
}

[ # new tile
pref_name: value
pref_name_2: value
]

[ # new tile
pref_name: value
pref_name_2: value
]

General note: all empty lines are ignore, so you an add as many whitelines as you want.
